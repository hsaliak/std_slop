# Contributing to std::slop

We appreciate your interest in contributing to `std::slop`! To maintain a focused and agent-driven development workflow, we have a unique contribution model.

## No Direct Pull Requests (PRs)

We do **not** accept traditional Pull Requests for code changes. All code modifications are handled internally to ensure consistency with our agent-driven development philosophy.

## Prompt-Based Contributions

Instead of code, we welcome contributions in the form of PRs aka  **prompt requests**. These prompts should clearly articulate a desired feature, bug fix, or improvement.

### Ideal Prompt Request Format

The most valuable prompt requests will be:

1.  **Generated by a `std::slop` Planner Persona**:
    If possible, use `std_slop` to generate a detailed, step-by-step plan. The agent will typically activate its internal `planner` skill automatically when asked to "plan" a feature. Alternatively, you can manually activate it via `/skill activate planner`. This demonstrates the viability of the approach within our own toolchain. The [USER GUIDE](USERGUIDE.md) file has more details on skills and orchestration.
2.  **Detailed and Step-by-Step**:
    The prompt should include a clear, actionable plan outlining the exact steps required to implement the desired change. This plan should break down the task into manageable components, ideally mirroring how an AI agent would approach the problem.

### Example Prompt Request Structure:

```text
**Feature Request: Implement XYZ functionality**

As generated by `std_slop` with `planner` skill activated:

**Plan:**
1.  **Analyze requirements**: Review existing ABC module to understand integration points.
2.  **Create new file `src/foo/xyz.cc`**: Define `XyzProcessor` class with method `process_data(data)`.
3.  **Implement `process_data`**: Add logic for data transformation and validation.
4.  **Add unit tests `src/foo/xyz_test.cc`**: Cover edge cases and successful execution.
5.  **Integrate with `main_app.cc`**: Call `XyzProcessor` from `main_app_loop()`.
6.  **Update documentation**: Add usage details to `README.md`.

**Reasoning:**
Implementing XYZ functionality will improve system performance by 15% during data ingestion, addressing user feedback from Issue #123. The plan prioritizes modularity and testability.
```

## How to Submit a Prompt Request

Please open a new issue on our GitHub repository and provide your prompt request in the description. If your plan is well-articulated and aligns with the project's goals, we will consider implementing it using our `std_slop` agent.
